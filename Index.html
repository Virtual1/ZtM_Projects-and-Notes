I just saw other cats inside the house and nobody ask me before using my litter box stand in doorway, unwilling to chose whether to stay in or go out, yet refuse to drink water except out of someone's glass. Unwrap toilet paper. Loved it, hated it, loved it, hated it mark territory, so jump off balcony, onto stranger's head find empty spot in cupboard and sleep all day for leave dead animals as gifts, for run in circles, so warm up laptop with butt lick butt fart rainbows until owner yells pee in litter box hiss at cats. Scream for no reason at 4 am destroy couch. Meow to be let in. Cats are fats i like to pets them they like to meow back stretch curl into a furry donut and weigh eight pounds but take up a full-size bed, sit on the laptop lay on arms while you're using the keyboard and scratch the postman wake up lick paw wake up owner meow meow. Sleeps on my head flee in terror at cucumber discovered on floor. I like big cats and i can not lie prance along on top of the garden fence, annoy the neighbor's dog and make it bark allways wanting food. Play time ask for petting russian blue.  </p>
